* Try panel -> tooltippanel for arrival times?
* show select stops in statusbar
* figure out why get*Pref causes a different nspref:changed
* investigate when predictions don't load
* better error handling for predictions
* see if bug causes given direction to be ignored at terminals
* sb get lost (maybe if they only affect one direction?)
* make requests only go to the current panel/statusbarpanel
* switch to using https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_JavaScript_code_modules
* remove/checktimes buttons enabled only when an item is selected
* use caching

mobile:
* alerts -> dump's ?
* make sure error handling works
* make listboxes usable (increase size, panning, etc)
* invalidate caches after configurable amount of time

Future:
* movable toolbox buttons of information
* grouping stops for arrival times
