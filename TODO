* Try panel -> tooltippanel for arrival times?
* show select stops in statusbar
* figure out why get*Pref causes a different nspref:changed
* sb get lost (maybe if they only affect one direction?)
* switch to using https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_JavaScript_code_modules

Future:
* movable toolbox buttons of information
* grouping stops for arrival times
* work with other bus systems (OSU, Chattanooga, Richmond, etc) <from Thomas Paul>
