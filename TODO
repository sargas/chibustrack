* Try panel -> tooltippanel for arrival times?
* show select stops in statusbar
* sb get lost (maybe if they only affect one direction?)

* Deleting sb route does not delete entries in cache

Future:
* movable toolbox buttons of information
* grouping stops for arrival times
* work with other bus systems (OSU, Chattanooga, Richmond, etc) <from Thomas Paul>
