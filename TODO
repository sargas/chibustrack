* Try panel -> tooltippanel for arrival times?
* colors for links in options
* first start panel
* restructure bus stops list
* show select stops in statusbar
* figure out why get*Pref causes a different nspref:changed
* break up directory structure
* investigate when predictions don't load
* better error handling for predictions
* see if bug causes given direction to be ignored at terminals
* sb get lost (maybe if they only affect one direction?)

Future:
* movable toolbox buttons of information
* grouping stops for arrival times
